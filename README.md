# naive compression experiments using enwik9

This is a testbed for me learning stuff about compression techniques, motivated by enwik9, although only compression ratios down to zip-like tools are approximately reached with far too large time and memory complexity..

current lowest size for the first 1 MB is ~320 kB using prepd>probcodes>huffman path (no run-length encoding).
